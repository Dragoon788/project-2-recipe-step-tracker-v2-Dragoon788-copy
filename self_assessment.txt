a. How did you challenge yourself in this project? 

This was the first time working on a project with React or Next.js. So initially it 
was already challenging to even be working on it; I began by watching tutorials on the basics
of React and Next.js in order to supplement my in class readings. I also challenged myself by using TypeScript
This was my first time writing and working in TypeScript, so it took me some time to be able to properly understand
all the syntax for my project.


b. What did you learn?

In this assignment, I learned work with context structures. Specifically for this
assignment I learned how to use modify, add, and remove nested context structures. 
From in-class activities, I learned a bit on how contexts worked, but this assignment
really challenged me to understand how manage various contexts and apply them properly. 
Furthermore learned how to destructure and spread states proved really difficult and took a lot of time learning
how to properly add, remove, and edit from a nested context structure (e.g. a dictionary of arrays).
In this assignment, I also learned how to work with tailwind and style my pages.
Lastly, I also learned how to manage and organize a project in the Next.js structure. I tried
my best to be able to create many small components that I would put together to make a larger organism.

What are areas of improvement for your work?

I'm very happy with how my assignment turned out as I spent a lot of time on the entire project, but
I think I could definitely improve on better managing my state. I think the stress of completing it,
make state very messy. I wish I could've had one state to manage all the recipes and recipe steps but ended
up having to split them into multiple contexts. Furthermore, I wish I had improved the card functionality in
order to change the description and image, but I think the product is a good demo of what could be further
improved on.
